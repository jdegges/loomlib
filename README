loomlib
=======

loomlib provides threading abstractions to help you weave threads in your
application.

Currently there are three basic structures available:
  1. Queue
  2. Asynchronous queue
  3. Thread pool
  4. Pipeline

Please refer to the appropriate header files for further more details. You may
also want to consult gurls (http://github.com/jdegges/gurls.git) to see an
example of how to use the thread pool structure.

The thread pool structure has taken inspiration from glib:
  http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/unstable/glib-Thread-Pools.html.
